// WorkflowRunner — durable workflow execution with an event-sourced journal.
//
// Cloudflare Workflows semantics verbatim: `step.do(name, fn)` memoized by the
// journal, `step.sleep`, `step.waitForEvent`, plus executor's `step.tool`
// (journal + audit in one). Kill mid-step -> restart -> completed steps do NOT
// re-execute (replay reads the journal). The self-hosted backing is a SQLite
// journal replay runner + in-process scheduler; the cloud backing (future) is
// CF Workflows + dynamic-workflows. The journal shape is modeled on
// vercel/workflow's World Storage contract (append-only events, materialized
// run/step views).
//
// The runner is substrate-neutral: it takes a `StepExecutor` (how to run a
// named step body / tool call for THIS run) so the sandbox/tool wiring stays
// outside the durable core. Runs pin the snapshot that started them.
