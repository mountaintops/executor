 * (DNS-rebinding defense): a cross-origin page can't read the token — it lives
 * in the real origin's storage and is sent as an explicit header, never an
 * ambient cookie — so it can't forge an authenticated request no matter which
 * host it connects through. Dropping the Host gate is what lets a local
 * instance be reached over a tailnet (or any hostname) with no extra flag.
 * These helpers express the bearer gate, the CORS origin allowlist, and the
 * single unauthenticated OAuth-callback carve-out.
