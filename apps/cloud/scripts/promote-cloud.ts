/**
 * Promote a specific, already-uploaded executor-cloud Worker version to a
 * chosen percentage of live traffic, using Cloudflare's staged
 * gradual-deployment model (`wrangler versions deploy`).
 *
 * This is the second half of the upload -> staged-promotion deploy flow
 * (see apps/cloud/DEPLOY.md and .github/workflows/deploy.yml). Merges upload a
 * version but route no traffic to it; this script promotes it deliberately.
 *
 * The version to promote is chosen EXPLICITLY, never inferred silently:
 *   --version <id>   promote exactly that version id (from
 *                    `wrangler versions list`). This is what advances an
 *                    existing canary: re-run at a higher --percent for the SAME
 *                    --version so you widen the version you already reviewed,
 *                    not whatever landed on main since.
 *   --version latest promote the most recently uploaded version. This is an
 *                    explicit opt-in for "promote what I just merged"; it is
 *                    NEVER the default, so advancing a rollout can never
 *                    accidentally promote unreviewed code.
 *
 * Percentage:
 *   --percent 100    promote the chosen version to 100% (full cutover).
 *   --percent 10     split traffic 10% chosen / 90% current-live version, for a
 *                    canary step. Re-run at a higher percentage (same version)
 *                    to advance; the DOs whose sessions land on the newly
 *                    promoted version restart, so keep early steps small and
 *                    watch telemetry between steps.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: a promotion that changes a Durable Object's assigned version
 * restarts that DO (validated empirically, DEPLOY.md experiments 3b/5). Stage
 * promotions to bound that blast radius.
 *
 * Reads no secrets beyond CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN / CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID (already
 * in the CI env). Config is the generated dist config the build produced.
