## Fresh Checkout / Worktree Setup

Run `bun run bootstrap` first in any fresh checkout or worktree. It is
idempotent: runs `bun install` (whose prepare hook builds the internal
packages dev servers fail without) and installs Playwright chromium.
Skipping it is why fresh worktrees die with "Failed to resolve entry for
package '@executor-js/vite-plugin'". The `vendor/` submodules are NOT
needed — nothing imports from `vendor/` at runtime; those forks are consumed
from npm (see `vendor/README.md`). `bun run bootstrap --forks` inits them
only when you're deliberately developing a fork.

## Environment Gotchas (learned the hard way)

- The shell is fish, and the working directory resets between Bash calls. Use
  absolute paths rooted at THIS worktree (check `pwd`), never
  `/Users/rhys/src/executor` from memory, and don't rely on a prior `cd`.
- Don't write probe scripts to `/tmp` — they can't resolve workspace packages
  (`effect`, `playwright`, ...). Put scratch scripts under the repo root
  (`scratch/` is gitignored) so bun resolves the workspace.
- `bun.lock` conflicts on rebase/merge: take either side, then re-run
  `bun install` to regenerate it — never hand-merge the lockfile.
- e2e dev-server ports are derived per checkout (`cd e2e && bun run ports`).
  If a boot reports a squatted port, an old dev server leaked — kill it by
  PID from the error message; don't move your own ports to dodge it.

## Task Completion Requirements

- Use Effect Vitest for tests.
- Run targeted tests with `vitest run ...` when working on a scoped area.
- The root/package `bun run test` scripts are allowed because they delegate to
  Vitest.
- NEVER run `bun test`.
- For code changes, run the narrowest useful verification before handing back.
- For broad or merge-ready changes, the full gates are `bun run format:check`,
  `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, and `bun run test`.

## Attribution

Do not add any AI assistant, Claude, Anthropic, or Co-Authored-By
attribution/trailers to commits, commit messages, PRs, or generated files.

Pull request titles and descriptions are going to a public GitHub repo, so
avoid using specific names or internal info unless explicitly stated to.

## Show Changes in PR Descriptions

When a change is user-visible and an e2e scenario covers it, embed the run's
recording in the PR description — reviewers should see the change, not just
read about it.

```
bun e2e/scripts/pr-media.ts e2e/runs/<target>/<scenario-slug>
```

converts the run's recording (browser `session.mp4` or `terminal.cast`) to a
gif, uploads it to the `e2e-media` branch, and prints PR-ready markdown to
paste into the body. Run screenshots (`*.png`) can be passed directly too. If
no scenario covers the change yet, that is usually the cue to write one.

## Service Emulators

When a test or demo needs an upstream API, OAuth/OIDC provider, or webhook
source, use the `@executor-js/emulate` emulators (GitHub, Google, Stripe,
Resend, WorkOS, and a dozen more) instead of writing a stub. They are
wire-level and stateful — real SDKs run against them unmodified — and each
one serves a full OpenAPI spec (`/_emulate/openapi`, ready for addSpec),
mints real-shaped credentials (`POST /_emulate/credentials`), runs working
OAuth flows, and records every call in a request ledger
(`/_emulate/ledger`) you can assert against. Hosted instances exist at
`https://<service>.emulators.dev` with zero setup. See the `emulate` skill
(`.claude/skills/emulate/SKILL.md`) for the control-plane reference and
recipes.

## Collaboration Notes

The user uses speech to text occasionally, so if sentences are weird or words
are not right, infer the likely intent and ask only when needed.

Code is very cheap to write. Do not give time estimates; with agents, code is
practically instant to generate. Unless stated otherwise, time to implement is
not a blocker.

## Reference Repos

Repos in `.reference`, such as Effect and effect-atom, are available for
patterns. If given a Git URL for reference, clone it into `.reference` and
inspect it there. Make sure to pull the latest changes from the reference repo
before using it.

## Engineering Priorities

- Prefer correctness and predictable behavior over short-term convenience.
- Preserve runtime behavior when changing lint, typing, or test structure.
- Keep package boundaries clear; use public package exports instead of relative
  imports across package roots.
- Extract shared logic only when the shared behavior is real and local patterns
  support it. Avoid broad generic abstractions for one-off duplication.

## Package Roles

- `packages/core/sdk`: executor core contracts, plugin wiring, scopes, sources,
  secrets, policies, and test fixtures. The `@executor-js/sdk/http-auth`
  subpath carries the shared placements-based auth-method vocabulary the HTTP
  protocol plugins compose (core itself never imports it — composition, not
  location, keeps core carrier-agnostic).
- `packages/core/storage-*`: storage adapters and storage test support.
- `packages/plugins/*`: protocol and provider plugins. Plugin-specific
  runtime, React, API, and testing helpers should live with the owning plugin.
- `packages/react`: shared React UI and atom/client integration.
- `packages/hosts/mcp`: MCP host surface for exposing Executor through MCP.
- `packages/kernel/*`: execution runtimes and code execution substrate.
- `apps/local`, `apps/cloud`, `apps/cli`, and `apps/desktop`: product entry
  points that compose the packages.
