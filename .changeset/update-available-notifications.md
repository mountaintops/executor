Notify when a newer Executor is published. The CLI now prints an "update available" line under its ready banner, and the web shell's sidebar update card works for real (a new `/v1/app/npm/dist-tags` endpoint backs it). In the desktop app the card shows a native "Restart to update" action wired to the in-app updater instead of the npm command. The check is best-effort and offline-safe, and can be disabled with `EXECUTOR_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK`.
