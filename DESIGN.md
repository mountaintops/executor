# Executor apps — self-hosted build (DESIGN.md)

Status: in progress. Durable record of the architecture, seam signatures,
package layout, key decisions, verification commands, and known gaps for the
executor apps subsystem built into the self-hosted deployment.

Note: the tracked design-system doc is `design.md` (lowercase). This uppercase
`DESIGN.md` is the apps-subsystem architecture record required by the build
brief.

## What this is

User-authored, git-backed, published units — **custom tools**, **durable
workflows**, **UI views**, **skills** — published into a per-scope store and
served/executed by the self-hosted platform. Identity is the file path
(`tools/issues-sync.ts` IS the tool `issues-sync`). Publish is the compiler
(FDI): catalog entries, schedules, ui resources and the skills index are
projections of a versioned descriptor extracted from source at publish.

The subsystem lives in one package, `@executor-js/plugin-apps`, wired into the
self-host app the same way every other plugin is (a source plugin in
`executor.config.ts`, HTTP routes as an extension, MCP tools/resources through
the MCP build hook). Everything substrate-specific sits behind a **seam** with
a substrate-neutral interface and a conformance suite that runs against the
interface, so future Cloudflare backings drop in without touching the
subsystem's logic.

## The five seams

Each seam is a substrate-neutral interface. Self-hosted backings are built now;
cloud backings are future. Everything crossing `ToolSandbox` is serializable
(the cloud version is RPC).

| Seam | Self-hosted backing (built) | Cloud backing (future) |
|---|---|---|
| `ArtifactStore` | bare git repo per scope on disk (git CLI subprocess); `SnapshotId` = commit hash | Cloudflare Artifacts |
| `ScopeDb` | one libSQL/SQLite file per scope + per-table version counters | DO facets |
| `ToolSandbox` | QuickJS kernel (collect + invoke via the `SandboxToolInvoker` bridge) | Worker Loaders |
| `WorkflowRunner` | SQLite event-sourced journal replay runner + in-process scheduler | CF Workflows + dynamic-workflows |
| `LiveChannel` | in-process emitter + SSE | DO/facet socket owner |

See `src/seams/*.ts` for the exact interfaces and `src/seams/*.conformance.ts`
for the suite each backing must pass.

## Decisions (and why)

- **Sandbox = QuickJS** (`packages/kernel/runtime-quickjs`). Its
  `CodeExecutor.execute(code, toolInvoker)` already gives the serializable
  handle bridge: `SandboxToolInvoker.invoke({path, args})` crosses as JSON,
  `tools.<...>()` is a Proxy in the sandbox, `fetch` is disabled, there is a
  deadline interrupt and a memory cap. secure-exec evaluated and rejected
  (pre-1.0, per-arch native sidecar, flat string bridge fighting the Proxy
  pattern); the Deno subprocess kernel is the documented harder-isolation
  escalation behind the same seam. Because QuickJS evaluates a *string*, the
  collect/invoke wrappers own the module shape: the published bundle is a
  self-executing script that either records `define*()` descriptors (collect)
  or calls one handler with injected clients (invoke).
- **Storage via host facades, not new tables.** Executor plugins deliberately
  do not contribute FumaDB tables (`collectTables()` is fixed and
  plugin-independent). App metadata (descriptors, snapshot pointers, schedules,
  workflow journal, ui metadata) lives in `pluginStorage` collections; large
  opaque blobs (compiled bundles, snapshot manifests) live in the `blobs`
  facade, content-addressed by SHA-256.
- **ScopeDb is separate from the executor DB.** App *data* (the `issues` table
  authors read/write) is one libSQL file per scope, independent of the
  executor's own DB. Per-table version counters live alongside it and drive
  `LiveChannel`.
- **Apps are a plugin source.** A published app maps to one executor
  *integration* per scope (`apps`); a *connection* to it makes the published
  tools catalog citizens through `resolveTools`/`invokeTool`, so
  policy/approval/audit/toolkits/tools.list all apply unchanged.
- **No @effect/workflow.** The local runner is a purpose-built SQLite
  event-sourced journal modeled on vercel/workflow's `World` Storage contract
  (append-only events, materialized run/step views, replay-on-resume).

## Package layout

```
packages/plugins/apps/
  src/
    seams/        ArtifactStore, ScopeDb, ToolSandbox, WorkflowRunner, LiveChannel
                  + one <seam>.conformance.ts per seam (runs against the interface)
    backing/      the self-hosted backing for each seam + their *.test.ts wiring
                  (git-artifact-store, libsql-scope-db, quickjs-tool-sandbox,
                   sqlite-workflow-runner, in-process-live-channel,
                   sqlite-apps-store) + the SIGKILL kill test
    pipeline/     discover -> bundle -> collect -> project (publish = the compiler)
    plugin/       runtime (the substrate-neutral core), bindings (connection DI),
                  store, apps-plugin (source: resolveTools/invokeTool),
                  self-host-runtime + self-host (one-call wiring)
    http/         publish + invoke + ui-bundle + SSE + workflow routes (web handler)
    mcp/          publish door, skills list/read, ui:// resources over MCP
    testing/      in-memory store, github REST resolver, daily-brief fixtures,
                  kill-child harness, the e2e proof
```

The subsystem is wired into `apps/host-selfhost/src/apps.ts` and mounted in
`app.ts` (extension route `/api/apps/*` + close hook). `apps.node.test.ts` boots
the real self-host server and drives publish -> ui-bundle -> tool-invoke.

## Seam signatures (the substrate-neutral contracts)

- `ArtifactStore.forScope(scope) -> ScopeArtifactStore { commit(files,msg) ->
  SnapshotMeta; read(id) -> FileSet; readFile; list; latest; log }`. SnapshotId =
  git commit hash.
- `ScopeDb.forScope(scope) -> ScopeDbHandle { sql`...`; exec; tableVersion;
  versions }` + `onWrite(listener)` (write events carry per-table versions).
- `ToolSandbox { collect(bundle) -> CollectResult; invoke(bundle, request,
  HandleBridge) -> InvokeResult }`. `HandleBridge.call({root, path, args}) ->
  Effect<unknown>` is the ONLY thing crossing the boundary — all JSON.
- `WorkflowRunner { start(input, execute, bindings); resume; signal; cancel; get;
  list; listSteps }`. `execute(DurableSteps) -> Promise` is the body; `bindings`
  = `{ runTool, notify }` reach the outside for `step.tool`/`step.notify`.
- `LiveChannel { publish(Invalidation); subscribe(scope, listener) }`.

## Two decisions worth review

1. **Workflow orchestration runs in-process; tool handlers run in the sandbox.**
   The durable body (`step.do`/`step.tool`/`step.sleep`/`step.waitForEvent`) is
   evaluated in-process via a trusted `new Function` shim because `step.do(name,
   () => ...)` closures cannot cross the sandbox boundary (the same reason CF
   runs the orchestrator in a constrained isolate with the journal as an external
   service). The real side-effectful work — every custom tool a `step.tool` calls
   — runs in the QuickJS sandbox with bound clients. The durability guarantee
   (journal + replay, proven by the SIGKILL kill test) is fully real. Flagging
   for review: hardening the orchestrator into the sandbox too (a `step` proxy
   bridged like the injected clients) is the natural follow-up if workflow bodies
   must be as isolated as tool handlers.

2. **The `ClientResolver` seam is where "policy/audit applies".** A tool's
   injected clients route method calls through `ClientResolver.call({integration,
   connection, path, args})`. In the e2e this is a real authenticated HTTP call
   to the emulate GitHub (proven via the emulator's request ledger). In the
   running self-host server the resolver returns a typed NotImplemented for
   external integrations because wiring it to the executor catalog needs
   per-request executor context the boot-time plugin construction does not hold.
   The scope-database path (`db.sql`) is fully live in the running server.
   Flagging for review: the clean fix is a host-provided per-request invoke
   function (executor.execute by address) handed to the resolver.

## Verification gates — exact commands + results

Run from the workspace root
(`usefulsoftwareco/.rifts/executor/apps-build-b`):

- **Typecheck (repo root):** `bun run typecheck` -> 43/43 tasks green.
- **Apps package (conformance + kill + pipeline + integration + e2e):**
  `bun run --filter='@executor-js/plugin-apps' test` -> 9 files, 32 tests pass.
  - ArtifactStore conformance (round-trip, snapshot immutability, log, isolation)
  - ScopeDb conformance (isolation, version bumps, tagged-template sql,
    LiveChannel delivery)
  - ToolSandbox conformance (determinism catches Math.random, network denial,
    timeout kill, handle-bridge round-trip incl. fan-out arrays)
  - WorkflowRunner conformance (memoization, sleep, waitForEvent+signal, retry,
    step.tool journaling) + the SIGKILL kill test (side-effect file written once)
  - publish pipeline (daily-brief -> descriptor; rejects npm imports + bad skill)
  - AppsRuntime end-to-end (publish -> invoke into scope db -> workflow)
  - the e2e proof (real GitHub emulator: publish MCP, invoke HTTP, workflow, ui
    MCP resource + raw bundle, SSE invalidation, skills MCP)
- **Existing self-host suite still green (touched by the wiring):**
  `bun run --filter='@executor-js/host-selfhost' test` -> 19 files, 75 tests pass
  (includes the new booted `apps.node.test.ts`).

The e2e is the single-command proof:
`bun run --filter='@executor-js/plugin-apps' test -- src/testing/e2e.test.ts`.

## Known gaps (honest list)

- **catalog() open-world proxy**: parsed + recorded in the descriptor; execution
  throws NotImplemented (in scope per the brief).
- **Running-server external-integration routing**: the ClientResolver returns
  NotImplemented for external APIs in the booted self-host server (decision 2
  above). The full real path is proven in the e2e against the emulator; the
  scope-db path is live in-server.
- **Workflow orchestrator isolation**: in-process (decision 1 above).
- **Scheduler**: schedules are extracted to the descriptor (IaC-visible) and a
  workflow can be started manually or by a caller; a standalone cron daemon that
  auto-fires due schedules is a thin wrapper over `startWorkflow` and is not
  built (the e2e/tests start runs explicitly). `step.sleep` timers are recorded
  but a wake-timer that auto-resumes sleeping runs is likewise a thin follow-up.
- **MCP registration into the shared server**: the apps MCP tools/resources are
  implemented and proven in the e2e against a real McpServer-shaped interface,
  and exposed via `registerMcp`. Hooking them into the shared
  `createExecutorMcpServer` build in the running server would touch shared api
  code (a registration callback); the HTTP publish door is wired in-server as the
  equivalent authoring path.
- **Effect-lint suggestions**: a handful of `preferSchemaOverJson` /
  `unnecessaryFailYieldableError` suggestions and `globalErrorInEffectFailure`
  warnings remain (non-fatal; the tsconfig plugin excludes them from the tsc exit
  code). Boundary `try/catch` in web handlers / subprocess callbacks would want
  targeted `oxlint-disable` comments before a lint gate.
